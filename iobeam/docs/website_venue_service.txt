What's required:

Iobeam wireless requires an internet connection at your location.  The
connection type and speed is irrelevant.  Our serivce works over ISDN, DSL,
T1.  It does *NOT* require a static IP address.

Iobeam wireless requires an Iobeam Service Gateway at each location you wish
you deploy wireless service.  You can purchase the gateway or use one of our
convenient lease options.

After a site survey, it might be necessary to add specialized antennas to
maximize coverage and signal strength at your location.  Most indoor locations
need only the standard antenna, included with the Iobeam Service Gateway.

How it works:

Install an internet connection at your location.  Purchase an Iobeam Service
Gateway from our online store, from your local sales representative or through 
an authorized Iobeam reseller.

Connect the gateway and configure it to use your ISP.

Wireless users can then immediately come and enjoy the benefits of wireless
internet access at your location.

At the end of every billing cycle, you will receive a revenue-share  check from Iobeam for
each installed location.
