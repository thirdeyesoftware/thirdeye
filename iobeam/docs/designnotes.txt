let customer be kroger.  kroger has 2 locations, A and B.  A and B must be
billed separately.  A has one service subscription, 'All Users'.  B has two
service subscriptions, 'All Employees' and 'Management'.  Having two separate
service subscriptions allows location B administrators to administer each user
list separately.
?how many accounts exist?
?who is the customer for A & B?

now let A be a corporate store and allow B to be a franchise which handles
it's own billing.  A's billing is handled by corporate.
? who is the customer for B?

now, make A and B be billed together.  A has two subscriptions, B has two
subscriptions.  Kroger wishes to track subscriptions by location.
?how many accounts exist?

is service subscription assigned location by account? may two service
subscriptions within an account have distinct locations?
