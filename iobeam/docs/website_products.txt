Hot Spot Operators:

Iobeam requires that each Iobeam Hot Spot install an Iobeam Service Gateway.

The ISG is a small, speciailized on-premises device that fulfills all the
necessary requirements to enable wireless access at a hot spot location.  The
ISG requires an upstream internet connection.  Although no specific kind of 
connection is required, Iobeam suggests a connection that has at least
256k of upstream bandwidth.  The ISG can be configured for all 
network environments using a web browser.

If you have questions about the ISG, send an email to sales@iobeam.com.
