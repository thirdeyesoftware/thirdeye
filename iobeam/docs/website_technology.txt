Iobeam's wireless network uses industry standards to communicate wirelessly
between the network access point and client devices such as PDAs and laptops.
The defacto standard and most commonly deployed wireless networks use
the unlicensed 2.4ghz radio frequency and the 802.11b protocol,
also called WiFi.  Wireless reception distance can vary but can be between 200 and 1000
feet.  Signal reception depends on many factors.  Environments free of radio
noise and other electro-magnetic interference yield the strongest signal and
longest ranges.

The Iobeam Service Gateway is a small, highly integrated  access device that 
provides a connection  between the hot spot venue and Iobeam's authentication and 
usage accounting services.  Hot Spot operators connect the ISG to their ISDN, DSL or 
Cable modems.  The ISG also has the capability to bridge the wireless network and an
existing local area network.  Once the ISG is configured, the hot spot location
is ready to accept wireless internet users.
