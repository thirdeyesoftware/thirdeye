ATLANTA (July 7, 2003) -- Iobeam, Inc., a wireless internet service provider
(www.iobeam.com) based in Atlanta, Georgia, and Preferred Jet Services, an
aviation services facility, announce the deployment of iobeam broadband
wireless internet service at McCollum Field, the sixth busiest corporate
airport in the Southeast United States.  Patrons of Preferred Jet Center can
enjoy the freedom and convenience of wireless internet access while utilizing
the many services Preferred Jet Center offers its charter and corporate
aviation customers.  Pilots, passengers, and visitors now have the benefit of
wireless internet access, using laptops and PDAs to conduct their professional
and personal business without troubling over wires or lack of available network
jacks or internet connections.  
<BR><BR>
"iobeam has provided us with an extremely valuable asset and we are very
excited about offering wireless service" says Jennifer Haddix, General Manager
of Preferred Jet Services. "Most of the pilots who bring their passengers here
stay here for quite a few hours and almost all of them have laptops.  We have a
small computer room where they have been able to set up their systems and plug
in, but now they have freedom of mobility and can enjoy our entire facility at
their leisure."

"The deployment of broadband WiFi at Preferred Jet Center provides a needed and
valuable service to mobile business customers who frequent one of the busiest
corporate airports in the Southeast," says Jeffrey Blau, Vice President of
iobeam.  "Our service at McCollum is also demonstrating the benefits of
wireless networks to infrastructure business in the field.  In addition to the
many advantages to the busy executive that needs to stay connected while
traveling, aviation service personnel who rely on network access in their daily
work are now free to move about the hangars and tarmac while accessing
management software or portals that were previously desk-bound."

As WiFi markets evolve, iobeam continues to make advances using efficient
integration of inexpensive technologies, often leapfrogging the alternatives
available to specific vertical industries preparing for full-scale wireless
deployment.
